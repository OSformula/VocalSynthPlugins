## V○CAL○ID3/4 (.lua)
**How to install them?**: Download your desired .lua files and drop them in (Program Files)\V○CAL○ID4\Editor\J○bPlugins, then in V3/V4 go to Job(J) -> Manage Job Plugins (M)
* **ListKeyNotes**: Create same-length notes in a specific key
  * **How it works?**: Set the Position wherever you want the notes and run the Plug-in. Everything else is self-explanatory.

  * **How it works?**: Choose a part in a VSQx and run the Plug-in.

# Note
As we don't know what's going to happen in the future with this synth or its compatibilities with future Windows OS, always make a backup of the file before running any plugin.
